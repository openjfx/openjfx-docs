<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    JavaFX allows you to create Java applications with a modern, 
    hardware-accelerated user interface that is highly portable. 
</p>
<p>
    There is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm">detailed reference 
    documentation for JavaFX</a>, and this short tutorial will show you how to write a JavaFX <span class="JFX_MAJOR">11</span> 
    application.
</p>
<p>
    For information on how to run JavaFX applications on mobile platforms, please see
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.gluonhq.com/#_getting_started">Getting Started with Gluon Mobile</a>.
</p>

<p>
    For information on Long Term Support (LTS) for JavaFX, please see
    <a target="_blank" href="https://gluonhq.com/services/javafx-support/">JavaFX Long Term Support options</a>.
</p>

<p>
    JavaFX builds on top of JDK and is a standalone component. There are 2 different options for 
    developing JavaFX applications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/">JavaFX SDK</a> (choosing between <span class="JFX_LTS_VERSION">17</span> LTS, latest release <span class="JFX_VERSION">15</span>, or an early access build).</li>
    <li>Use a build system (e.g. maven/gradle) to download the required modules from Maven Central (choosing as well between the same mentioned versions).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For JavaFX <span class="JFX_VERSION">24</span>, JDK <span class="MIN_JDK">21</span> or later is required. For LTS versions, at least JDK <span class="MIN_JDK_LTS">21</span> is required.
