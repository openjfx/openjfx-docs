<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    JavaFX allows you to create Java applications with a modern, 
    hardware-accelerated user interface that is highly portable. 
</p>
<p>
    This tutorial will help you to write a JavaFX <span class="JFX_MAJOR">11</span> application and run it 
    on desktop platforms. For information on how to run JavaFX applications on
    mobile platforms, please see 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.gluonhq.com/getting-started/">Getting Started with Gluon Mobile</a>.
</p>
<p>
    JavaFX <span class="JFX_MAJOR">11</span> builds on top of JDK <span class="JDK_MAJOR">11</span> and is a standalone component. There are 2 different options for 
    developing JavaFX applications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/">JavaFX SDK.</a></li>
    <li>Use a build system (e.g. maven/gradle) to download the required modules from Maven Central.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For both options, it is required to have a recent version of JDK <span class="JDK_MAJOR">11</span>.
